## Project title 
Coneic / ReCone
//

Think a simple, straightforward title, can also be poetic or playful but keep it short. 

## Research Question / area of research
How can objects create new functions through human interpretation?

## Pitch
My project are playful cones that wait for others to explore.//

One sentence to describe what is your concept. (~100 chars max)  For example: "My project is a sound tapestry that records and transform human conversations".
+ Key visual (from your 3D renderings or your paper prototypes)
+ Optional second visual

## Prototyping research
- observation
- experiments
- research and references
- prototype and interactions

//

Describe in a short paragraph (~500 chars) the research that you have conducted around your prototypes. What were your intentions? What are the several forms you looked into? What were the different interactions you tried? Illustrate each method with corresponding photo, sketches, audio, movies, 3D visuals etc. You can put a lot of elements here, but please curate the most illustrative materials.

## Your key prototype
playful cones that wait for others to explore
unintentional design and user innovation
Encouraging Secondary Production
Sustainability in Creativity
Creative products are defined by their capacity to inspire and facilitate secondary production. They succeed when they act as tools, frameworks, or prompts, empowering users to explore, create, and iterate. In doing so, they embody a unique fusion of unintentional design and intentional innovation, where the user's input ultimately defines the product's creativity. and stimulate the story and life in the robots
//

Short paragraph (~250 chars) describing the prototype and your concept, what it does, how does it act, why does it exist etc.

+ One photo of the paper prototype (can be gif animation, or static)
+ One 3D image 
+ (Optional) Video

## User scenario
video 
//
+ Your storyboard showing how your prototype can be used 

## Next Steps
- Adding and designing more interactions
- Enriching the behind and playful stories
- Combining and arranging the electronics
