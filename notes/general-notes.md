### Prototype brainstorming1

from the **Solitude**, human beings increasingly need the accompany of pets, and what about pets? pets have Separation Anxiety, and there’s a Pet Attachment Theory, Biophilia Hypothesis (亲生命假说)<br>
a soft robotics that soft and furry, the entire body is made up of several strips, it **Glides** and move like **Waves**, less active more passive, stay and wrap in home and transfer any furniture into a “cat climbing frame” thing, would **Purr** when fill pressed (the **Tension** sensor), the interaction could be in purposed or not.

domestic spaces: 

functional areas, spacial areas; <br>
related to human life and culture, home, social relation, identities, not just physical but dynamic space;<br>
embody a duality, represent both intimate family arrangements and sites for inequality [为什么我的男友和闺蜜不能同时看裸体 - 概念 补]<br>
