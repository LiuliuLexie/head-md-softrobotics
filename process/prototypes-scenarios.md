The Chronicles of Misused Robotics in 2050. 

### 1. The Jellyfish Robot
“I have a little jellyfish robot designed in 2026 to monitor air quality and regulate humidity. Instead, I’ve attached it to my ceiling fan to create a whimsical light show. It pulsates colors that mimic the ocean’s depths while I enjoy my morning coffee. My guests think I’m a creative genius, but really, I just wanted to distract them from the peeling paint on my walls.”

**Interaction**: The jellyfish gently sways, emitting soothing colors. Sometimes, it unexpectedly releases a puff of mist, catching guests off guard.

### 2. The Blanket as a Security System**
“I found a soft robotic blanket originally designed to provide temperature control. Now, it’s a makeshift security system for my front door. When someone approaches, it vibrates wildly, alerting me to potential intruders—or maybe just my neighbor’s cat.”

**Interaction**: The blanket flops around comically, making it look like it’s waving frantically, providing a bizarre but effective alarm system. 

### 3. The Dress-Up Companion**
“I inherited a soft robotic companion designed to help dress children. It now hangs in my closet, holding my hats. Every time I reach for a cap, it springs to life, giving a little twirl. It’s like my personal hat mannequin, but I sometimes wonder if it’s plotting to wear my favorite hat next.”

**Interaction**: When touched, the robot performs a little dance, adding an element of surprise to the mundane act of grabbing a hat.

### 4. The Luggage Case as a Time Capsule**
“I own a smart luggage case from 2029, designed to keep track of travel itineraries. It’s now my kitchen cabinet for odd kitchen gadgets. Occasionally, it starts spouting off travel tips and recipes, giving my friends the impression that I’m well-traveled and cultured.”

**Interaction**: It randomly opens up to reveal a hidden compartment, showcasing old travel souvenirs, as it tries to narrate stories of distant lands.
