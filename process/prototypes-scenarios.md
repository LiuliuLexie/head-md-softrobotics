## 2024-10-22~25 - prototypes and storyboards/scenarios 
STORYBOARD/SCENARIO: the experience people lived through the whole interaction, be more detailed and include all the stages; can do paper prototype and record the interaction; think of your robot as a story <br>

IN SUMMARY FROM YOUR SCENARIO WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
- WHERE - Where does exist?
- WHO- For who is it?
- WHAT - What is it? What does it do?
- HOW - How does it behave? How do people get the information they need?How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?
- WHY - Why does it exist?

**my stuck point: this behaviors are originally very random, but now i need to design from this non-design thing<br>**

definition and identity: the space and the people inside exist, then it exist or has its use, if the space and human interaction disappears, then its useless

### 1. a whatever use thing

- where: any place in room
- who: any creature in the room
- what: something interesting/attractive but useless thing, or to say, people cant define its identity on the first glace and need to explore how it works
- how: people can easily catch it, grab it, throw it whereever in the room, it will adpat to whatever things, cover them and form a new platform;  ...free to explore
- why: give an insight on the misbehavior or misused things in our room

### 2. lamp

- where: any place in room
- who: any creature in the room
- what: originally a lamp shape but cant light (cant be used as a lamp), looks simple
- how: when people put anything on it, it would grow and generate the upper part of it into shapes that hold handy things, or become a box
- why:
