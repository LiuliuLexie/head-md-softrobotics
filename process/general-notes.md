Iteration: explore a lot of different ideas, different versions <br>
Interaction: communication and engagement, people <-> automated systems, refer [*The concept of “interaction” in debates on human–machine interaction*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02060-8)<br>

WHO interacts?<br>
HOW do theese subjects interact? <br>
for WHAT REASON is interaction taking place?<br>
under WHAT CONDITIONS (WHERE) is interaction taking place?<br>

ONE key interaction, the simpel the interesting, the better<br>
refer: [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/), [play date](https://play.date/), *Katamari Damacy* (video game)<br>
AGENCY: user ability to perform meaningful actions and have a sense of control; their choices translate into real changes;actively engage; create a sense that user decisions matter and impact the outcome<br>
PERSONALITY: how you define the soft robotics, refer [superflux](https://superflux.in/#): [Our friends x electric](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/friends-electric/#)<br>
FEEDBACK<br>
INPUT/OUTPUT<br>

### Exercise 1
list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment, focus on where the robot could be placed* and how it might interact with the surroundings<br>

Places
- corner, a place easy to be ignored but always importation for useless things
- door/wall/anyplace can hang things, these are more like free spaces in domestic place that must exist but most of the space on them is not used as the main function (eg, door mainly using the handle but not on door), so its available and free for adaption
- on table, jsut as a normal object
- under the bed or by bedside, ignored, random, handy
- in closet as a canbinet, most of them are turned into that way
- along the daily routine

### Exercise 2
list of potential interactions and geed back mechanism of the robot<br>

Interaction, input/output
- grow, generate into shapes that hold handy things, flexible
- play sound, to remind, or to show the existence
- light, shine as the lamp but function in different way
- heat, a little bit critical, but to avoid the handy and random use
- viberate, can be either 1 of upper 3
- movement, move following the usual daily routine of the owner of the house, to become handy 
- connect, connect with all the misused objects, contact? communicate with them or link them together, like the main brain of the IoT
- time length of the owner staying in room or putting something on it
- message
- gesture
- adapt, when thrown onto some messy things or corner, 

### Exercise 3
Using your ideas from exercises 1 and 2, write a short paragraph in markdown that describes what your soft robot does, where it resides in the home, and who it interacts with. Feed this text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your concept.
Following this, create a series of quick prototypes that summarize the key points from your concept and your conversations with the AI.<br>
AIs can be used: huggingChat, chatGPT, v0, Gemini, etc.<br>

**Comments from profs (tutorial notes):**<br>
goes too fast, we dont need to see what the project looks like now<br>
go less general but put the interesting keywords <br>
"misusing" wrong uses <br>
misused robots?/gestures, the robot itself is misused <br>
a wrong intention in the first time <br>
hacking, hijack, a creative use if not the official use, personalized use
references <br>
people doing stupid things<br>
more the gesture, interaction, ...<br>
repurposing<br>
try doing a disign fiction: collecting "i have a little jellyfish robot designed in 2026, ... " sci-fi way <br>

## 2024-10-22

focus on interaction<br>
start looking at robots, interactions<br>
research, exploration<br>

STORYBOARD/SCENARIO: the experience people lived through the whole interaction, be more detailed and include all the stages; can do paper prototype and record the interaction; think of your robot as a story <br>
IN SUMMARY FROM YOUR SCENARIO WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
- WHERE - Where does exist?
- WHO- For who is it?
- WHAT - What is it? What does it do?
- HOW - How does it behave? How do people get the information they need?How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?
- WHY - Why does it exist?

**More comments from profs(tutorial notes):**<br>
functional? x <br>
misbehaving<br>
personality <br>
dangerous<br>
unfilter<br>
funk<br>
human truth go deeep <br>
why > go deep into the reasons<br>
start from observation, give more human-truth<br>
transformation<br>
hack<br>
personal growth<br>

**Comments from Ban:**<br>
树叶 -> 书签<br>
define a things into another function<br>
主被动关系 -> i dont originally need, but turned into<br>
设计一个interesting/attractive but useless thing -> user去发挥 <br>
can be easily defined but don't know how to use<br>
leave the imagination space to the user<br>
detailed bakground, reasons <br>
interaction: throw -> be box<br>
my stuck point: this behaviors are originally very random, but now i need to design from this non-design thing<br>

>start prototypes and scenarios > prototypes-scenarios.md

**More comments from profs (tutorial notes):**<br>
still need intention<br>
maybe can experience around circles<br>
open but give it some clues, maybe its extendable<br>
experiments - people find definition, see what they do<br>
a bag - open up space, creating a space that is not there<br>
zip<br>
give it something, to adopt<br>
not a lamp but look like a lamp, start with the lamp shape, sth clearly not a lamp but in lamp shape<br>
how people use a simple string<br>
deconstract elements on them <br>

Reference recommended: design noir<br>
create the incomplete design that they suggest something, a shape, or wave, and give people -> give them a card and see how they define

**Comments from profs(after presentation)**<br>
recommened refer from Chakir: [More unremarkable and odd places in Mario 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SybPxb_DjZ4&t=519s)<br>
3rd proto most promising, nudging, prompt from user, different types of prompting and nudging, a lot of possibilities, play with the ideas <br>
fill the gap, collabrating with other objects and create new one; but Suglue already<br>
4th idea: randomness still working with the overlooked corners, viberation, interactive, input some significance into it, not obvious, the tapping is interesting, like a reset<br>
feel like different transformations from one dough<br>
try to generate "new" objects and experiment with people [ai generator web](https://futuremirror.vercel.app/)<br>

**Comments from profs and researchers after the presentation**<br>
a story in narrative interpretation<br>
[the Death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author) >> the Death of the Designer<br>
kill the designer or try to have more control on the people by misleading them? kill the designer but inviting more designers<br>
infinite design because of unfinished design, unfinished objects to people and they need to finish the objects, a lot of experiments<br>
Maybe a next-step after deconstructing the designer = author, would be to look at Michel De Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life
https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf<br>
personalized exercises: kill one and invite more, think about cues nudging people<br>
invitation, create strange objects<br>
cues nudging people, invitation, create strange objects<br>
more physical things next week<br>
think about the softness <br>

problem: the ai generator is not creative at all and very much creating something based on the original pic, the shape and structure,, more on real combined objects 
![aigenerator3.png](pic/aigenerator3.png)

**mid check with Alexia**
tryo own combinition of physical things inside of collage pictures<br>
give some context, like a usage, not object-driven but usage-driven <br>
prototypes and 3D objects, more active, "invite"<br>
unfinish - finish<br>

Experiment with one action keyword and one line
![experiment.jpg](pic/experiment.jpg)
but i dont know what to do with them
