### Prototype brainstorming1

from the **Solitude**, human beings increasingly need the accompany of pets, and what about pets? pets have Separation Anxiety, and there’s a Pet Attachment Theory, Biophilia Hypothesis (亲生命假说)<br>
a soft robotics that soft and furry, the entire body is made up of several strips, it **Glides** and move like **Waves**, less active more passive, stay and wrap in home and transfer any furniture into a “cat climbing frame” thing, would **Purr** when fill pressed (the **Tension** sensor), the interaction could be in purposed or not.

Iteration: explore a lot of different ideas, different versions <br>
Interaction: communication and engagement, people <-> automated systems, refer [*The concept of “interaction” in debates on human–machine interaction*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02060-8)<br>

WHO interacts?<br>
HOW do theese subjects interact? <br>
for WHAT REASON is interaction taking place?<br>
under WHAT CONDITIONS (WHERE) is interaction taking place?<br>

ONE key interaction, the simpel the interesting, the better<br>
refer: [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/), [play date](https://play.date/), *Katamari Damacy* (video game)<br>
AGENCY: user ability to perform meaningful actions and have a sense of control; their choices translate into real changes;actively engage; create a sense that user decisions matter and impact the outcome<br>
PERSONALITY: how you define the soft robotics, refer [superflux](https://superflux.in/#): [Our friends x electric](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/friends-electric/#)<br>
FEEDBACK<br>
INPUT/OUTPUT<br>

### Exercise 1
list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment, focus on where the robot could be placed* and how it might interact with the surroundings<br>

Places
- corner, a place easy to be ignored but always importation for useless things
- door/wall/anyplace can hang things, these are more like free spaces in domestic place that must exist but most of the space on them is not used as the main function (eg, door mainly using the handle but not on door), so its available and free for adaption
- on table, jsut as a normal object
- under the bed or by bedside, ignored, random, handy
- in closet as a canbinet, most of them are turned into that way
- along the daily routine

### Exercise 2
list of potential interactions and geed back mechanism of the robot<br>

Interaction, input/output
- grow, generate into shapes that hold handy things, flexible
- play sound, to remind, or to show the existence
- light, shine as the lamp but function in different way
- heat, a little bit critical, but to avoid the handy and random use
- viberate, can be either 1 of upper 3
- movement, move following the usual daily routine of the owner of the house, to become handy 
- connect, connect with all the misused objects, contact? communicate with them or link them together, like the main brain of the IoT
- time length of the owner staying in room or putting something on it
- message
- gesture
- adapt, when thrown onto some messy things or corner, 

### Exercise 3
Using your ideas from exercises 1 and 2, write a short paragraph in markdown that describes what your soft robot does, where it resides in the home, and who it interacts with. Feed this text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your concept.
Following this, create a series of quick prototypes that summarize the key points from your concept and your conversations with the AI.<br>
AIs can be used: huggingChat, chatGPT, v0, Gemini, etc.<br>

**Comments from profs (tutorial notes):**<br>
goes too fast, we dont need to see what the project looks like now<br>
go less general but put the interesting keywords <br>
"misusing" wrong uses <br>
misused robots?/gestures, the robot itself is misused <br>
a wrong intention in the first time <br>
hacking, hijack, a creative use if not the official use, personalized use
references <br>
people doing stupid things<br>
more the gesture, interaction, ...<br>
repurposing<br>
try doing a disign fiction: collecting "i have a little jellyfish robot designed in 2026, ... " sci-fi way <br>
not used， wired 荒诞的<br>
go into a future background conversation<br>

## 2024-10-22

focus on interaction<br>
start looking at robots, interactions<br>
research, exploration<br>

STORYBOARD/SCENARIO: the experience people lived through the whole interaction, be more detailed and include all the stages; can do paper prototype and record the interaction; think of your robot as a story <br>
IN SUMMARY FROM YOUR SCENARIO WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
- WHERE - Where does exist?
- WHO- For who is it?
- WHAT - What is it? What does it do?
- HOW - How does it behave? How do people get the information they need?How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?
- WHY - Why does it exist?

**More comments from profs(tutorial notes):**<br>
functional? x <br>
misbehaving<br>
personality <br>
dangerous<br>
unfilter<br>
funk<br>
human truth go deeep <br>
why > go deep into the reasons<br>
start from observation, give more human-truth<br>
transformation<br>
hack<br>
personal growth<br>

**Comments from Ban:**<br>
树叶 -> 书签<br>
define a things into another function<br>
主被动关系 -> i dont originally need, but turned into<br>
设计一个interesting/attractive but useless thing -> user去发挥 <br>
can be easily defined but don't know how to use<br>
leave the imagination space to the user<br>
detailed bakground, reasons <br>
interaction: throw -> be box<br>
my stuck point: this behaviors are originally very random, but now i need to design from this non-design thing<br>

>start prototypes and scenarios > prototypes-scenarios.md

**More comments from profs (tutorial notes):**<br>
still need intention<br>
maybe can experience around circles<br>
open but give it some clues, maybe its extendable<br>
experiments - people find definition, see what they do<br>
a bag - open up space, creating a space that is not there<br>
zip<br>
give it something, to adopt<br>
not a lamp but look like a lamp, start with the lamp shape, sth clearly not a lamp but in lamp shape<br>
how people use a simple string<br>
deconstract elements on them <br>

Reference recommended: design noir<br>
create the incomplete design that they suggest something, a shape, or wave, and give people -> give them a card and see how they define
