# wkshp3: Soft Robotics
This markdown file is mainly general notes and quick idea explorations during classes.

## 2024-10-14

### General wkshp brief and concept

hardware → software <br>
more adaptive <br>
more human, jump out from the typical one<br>
inspiration from nature, more organic <br>
interaction between humans and robotics<br>
beyond labor (don’t do labor), domestic lives 家庭生活？ more relationship<br>
novel combinations<br>
application and new usage<br>
paper prototype, the jury<br>
3D file for industrial/product design<br>

### Prototype brainstorming1

from the **Solitude**, human beings increasingly need the accompany of pets, and what about pets? pets have Separation Anxiety, and there’s a Pet Attachment Theory, Biophilia Hypothesis (亲生命假说)<br>
a soft robotics that soft and furry, the entire body is made up of several strips, it **Glides** and move like **Waves**, less active more passive, stay and wrap in home and transfer any furniture into a “cat climbing frame” thing, would **Purr** when fill pressed (the **Tension** sensor), the interaction could be in purposed or not.

domestic spaces: 

functional areas, spacial areas; <br>
related to human life and culture, home, social relation, identities, not just physical but dynamic space;<br>
embody a duality, represent both intimate family arrangements and sites for inequality [为什么我的男友和闺蜜不能同时看裸体 - 概念 补]<br>

Iteration: explore a lot of different ideas, different versions <br>
Interaction: communication and engagement, people <-> automated systems, refer [*The concept of “interaction” in debates on human–machine interaction*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02060-8)<br>

WHO interacts?<br>
HOW do theese subjects interact? <br>
for WHAT REASON is interaction taking place?<br>
under WHAT CONDITIONS (WHERE) is interaction taking place?<br>

ONE key interaction, the simpel the interesting, the better<br>
refer: [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/), [play date](https://play.date/), *Katamari Damacy* (video game)<br>
AGENCY: user ability to perform meaningful actions and have a sense of control; their choices translate into real changes;actively engage; create a sense that user decisions matter and impact the outcome<br>
PERSONALITY: how you define the soft robotics, refer [superflux](https://superflux.in/#): [Our friends x electric](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/friends-electric/#)<br>
FEEDBACK<br>
INPUT/OUTPUT<br>

### Exercise 1
list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment, focus on where the robot could be placed* and how it might interact with the surroundings<br>

Places
- corner, a place easy to be ignored but always importation for useless things
- door/wall/anyplace can hang things, these are more like free spaces in domestic place that must exist but most of the space on them is not used as the main function (eg, door mainly using the handle but not on door), so its available and free for adaption
- on table, jsut as a normal object
- under the bed or by bedside, ignored, random, handy
- in closet as a canbinet, most of them are turned into that way
- along the daily routine

### Exercise 2
list of potential interactions and geed back mechanism of the robot<br>

Interaction, input/output
- grow, generate into shapes that hold handy things, flexible
- play sound, to remind, or to show the existence
- light, shine as the lamp but function in different way
- heat, a little bit critical, but to avoid the handy and random use
- viberate, can be either 1 of upper 3
- movement, move following the usual daily routine of the owner of the house, to become handy 
- connect, connect with all the misused objects, contact? communicate with them or link them together, like the main brain of the IoT
- time length of the owner staying in room or putting something on it
- message
- gesture

### Exercise 3
a short para, what the soft robot does, where it resides in the home and who it interact with. feed text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your concept -> quick prototypes, key points get<br>
AIs can be used: huggingChat, chatGPT, v0, Gemini, etc.<br>
